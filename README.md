# Shop Application

This is a React-based shop application powered by NX for efficient development and build management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (we recommend using the latest LTS version).
- **NX** will be used to manage and build the application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the dev server

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
 npm start
```

or

```bash
npx nx serve shop-application
```

This will start the development server and allow you to view the application in the browser (usually at http://localhost:4200).

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any strange caching issues, you can reset the NX cache by running:

```bash
 npx nx reset
```

This will clear all cached files, which can often resolve issues related to outdated or corrupted caches.
